# Tidal Install

## Setup

* Make sure that `stack` is installed and available on the command line.
* Either run the `setup` bash script or directly run `stack setup --install-ghc && stack build`
* Run `tidal` to start up the ghci session, or directly run `stack exec ghci -- -ghci-script Setup.ghci`

Might take a while the first time as everything is downloaded, should be relatively quick after that.
